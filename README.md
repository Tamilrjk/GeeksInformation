## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the data science skills and techniques I've learned during my GeeksInformation internship. It includes data collection, analysis, and model building on a real-world dataset.

## Project Structure

- /data: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- /notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with data analysis and model building code.
- /scripts: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- /results: Stores project results and visualizations.

## Data Collection and Preparation

We obtained the dataset from [source](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxZFXUfhA/GckT-pHr_cxghIrNT5wZAg/view) and preprocessed it by removing missing values and outliers. The cleaned data is stored in the `data` directory.

## Data Analysis

We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics. Key findings include [brief findings].

## Model Building

We trained a machine learning model using the dataset and achieved an accuracy of [accuracy]. The code for the model is available in the `notebooks` directory.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in data science and machine learning. It highlighted the importance of data preparation, analysis, and model evaluation.
